GUI I Programming

## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment was to create a dynamic single page web application and generate a table 
dynamically based on user input. I created a single web page application and prompted the user for
3 inputs (The price of the car, the MPG, and current price of gas per gallon). I then constructed a table by 
using the what the user entered to display the price of the car, the cost of gas, the miles per cost per gallon 
(quite a mouthful), and the total cost after 60,000 miles which is sum of the total cost of the car plus the additional 
cost of gas that is consumed within the 60K miles. 

## Overview

* A simple HTML file

```index.html```

* A single JavaScript file

```main.js```

* CSS Bootstrap 

```https://getbootstrap.com/```

## Impress Me 

I created a single page web application and have the table hidden and then shown using JQuery
I also used Bootstrap as mentioned in class to provide a beautiful interface (just my opinion) 
Also the input is handled "gracefully" such that the user can only enter numbers and not random characters
