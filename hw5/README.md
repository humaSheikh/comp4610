## HW 5 

An update from HW4. This time we play around with a JQuery validation library plugin which validates user input. 
I've tested the validation as much as possible and can conclude that it is for the most part bulletproof. 

## Impress Me 

For this portion of the assignment, I've again used bootstrap to give the application a nice interface which is appealing to
the eye. I have also hidden the table and then caused the table to appear when the submit button has been pressed to display
the populated table. Also I like to keep my apps simple. In other words, the less complexity in the UI, the better the design.
